# Basic Security Log Analysis and Visualization

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing security logs using the CICIDS2017 dataset. The goal is to identify potential security threats through data manipulation and visualization techniques in Python.

## Objectives
- Learn Python basics for data analysis.
- Use pandas for data manipulation.
- Create visualizations with Matplotlib/Seaborn.
- Gain cybersecurity insights by analyzing security logs.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The project utilizes the CICIDS2017 dataset, which includes a wide range of simulated attack scenarios and normal operations for network traffic.

## Setup Instructions
1. Install Python and Jupyter Notebook.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Install required Python packages: `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn`.
4. Download the CICIDS2017 dataset and place it in the `data/raw/` directory.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for analysis and visualization.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data cleaning and visualization.
- `outputs/`: Storage for figures and analysis results.

## How to Use
1. Start by running the data cleaning script to prepare your dataset.
2. Explore the dataset with the EDA notebook.
3. Use the Final Analysis notebook for deeper insights and visualizations.
